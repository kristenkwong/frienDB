  h2 DELETE
  p A #[strong deletion with cascades] means that if the tuple that is part of a foreign key for another tuple in another table is deleted, that deletion cascades downwards and also deletes the tuple.

  p A deletion is done using the following SQL statement:

  pre.
    DELETE * FROM users WHERE username = //username//;

  p The deletion on cascade is implemented when the table is created (or when it's altered) like so:

  pre.
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users (username) ON DELETE CASCADE

  h3 In our project:

  ul
    li We have implemented this in the #[strong user and post] relationship, where if the user is deleted, his/her posts are also deleted.
    p You can see this in action
      a(href='/home/users')  [ here ]
      |  by clicking on any user profile, and deleting the user. Then, navigate to the list of posts, and you can see that all of the posts from that user are deleted.
    li This is implemented by an 'ON DELETE CASCADE' when listing an attribute as a foreign key on table create or alter.

  p A #[strong deletion without cascading] means that even if that tuple is deleted, other tuples are not deleted.
  ul
    li For example, when a post is deleted, a user is not deleted.
